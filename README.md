# The aim of this project is to classifypeoples emotions based on their face images.
# In this case study, there is a collection of more than 20000 facial images, with their associated facial expression labels and around 2000 images with their facial key-point annotations.
# Two models which are used in the project are

# 1. Facial Key Points Detection Model
# In this model we will create a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network and Residual Blocks to predict facial key-points.

# 2. Facial Expression(Emotion) Detection Model
# The second model will classify peoples emotion.
# The data contains images that belong to 5 categories.
# 0-Angry
# 1-Disgust
# 2-Sad
# 3-Happy
# 4-Surprise
